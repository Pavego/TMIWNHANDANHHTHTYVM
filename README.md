## About the mod

The Mod In Which Natsuki Has A Nice Day And Nothing Horrible Happens To Her, Thank You Very Much (TMIWNHANDANHHTHTYVM) is a mod in which...you get the point.

AND IT'S FINALLY RELEASED.

Version 1.0.1: Updated ending message so it doesn't get confused for an error.
Version 1.0.2: Fixed some errors, hopefully it worked.
Version 1.1.0: Added Natsuki pyjamas, improved dialogue
Version 1.1.1: Emergency bug and dialogue fixes. Thanks to SavageSentral for noticing the issues!
Version 1.1.2: Fixed a softlock that might not even occur. Can't be bothered to test it.

Like all other DDLC mods, it is supposed to be played AFTER the main game and it requires the main game to even run.
Just download the mod from here and copy the content into a clean install of DDLC.
