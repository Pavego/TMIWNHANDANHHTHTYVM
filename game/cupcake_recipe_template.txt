Ingredients:

-125g of self raising flour

-125g of caster sugar

-340g of icing sugar

-275g of ROOM TEMPERATURE unsalted butter (very important)

-1/4tsp of BICARBONATE soda

-1/2tsp of vanilla extract

-Around 5-6 tbsp of milk (up to you to pick a type)

-2 eggs

-Food colouring of your choice

-Chocolate pieces

Cupcakes:

-Sift the flour, bi-carb and caster sugar into a mixing bowl. Add eggs and 125g of the butter into the bowl and combine it all. (if using electronic mixer, start on a low speed)

-Once everything has combined, mix on a high speed for 1 minute.

-Make sure to combine 1 1/2tbsp of milk with a 1/4tsp of vanilla extract in a separate bowl. Start adding this to the batter slowly while mixer is on medium speed for 30 seconds.

-Scrape all the bits from the sides and bottom of the bowl.

-Preheat oven to 170 Celsius or 338 Fahrenheit.

-Use 2 spoons to scope the batter into cupcake trays around 2/3 full, allowing it to rise in the oven. (use cupcake paper/moulds)

-Bake cupcakes for 22 minutes. (times may vary slightly)

-Allow cupcakes to cool before decorating. (WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT REFRIGERATE THEM. THEY WILL GO HARD AND IT TASTES HORRIBLE)

Buttercream/icing:

-Add the remaining 150g of butter into a mixing bowl and mix for 5 minutes. (start on a low speed and work your way up) Butter should go a fluffy white colour.

-Add HALF of the icing sugar into the bowl and mix for 3-5 minutes, first on a slow speed, then to a medium speed. Add the other half and then repeat.

-Combine 3-4tbsp of milk and 1/4tsp of vanilla extract into a separate bowl. You DO NOT need to add all of this to the mixture. While the mixer is on a low speed, add small amounts of the milk into the bowl. You will know when you have added enough when the mixture is just able to hold its shape. (Runny icing is not nice)

Decoration:

IF YOU WANT DIFFERENT COLOURED ICING then separate a small portion of icing into a bowl and add the colouring there. You can then add that back into the mixing bowl while the mixer is on to make all the icing one colour.

IF YOU WANT MULTIPLE COLOURS then split the mixture and add the different colour while the mixer is on to even distribute the colour.

-Use icing bags for the different coloured icings. Alternatively you can apply it with a knife, but we all know how that will end cough.

-Use the white coloured icing as the backdrop/the base layer of the decoration. It is important that the icing is somewhat even.

-If you are drawing a cat face, then use the other colour to do the details. (You have freedom here, go crazy)

-Don't forget to add bits of chocolate for the ears! :3
